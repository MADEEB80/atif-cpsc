Cantt Public School and College has been providing educational facilities through its dynamic approach, focusing on core values such as honesty, loyalty, perseverance, and compassion. Our students include wards of Cantonment Board Malir employees, residents of Malir Cantt, and many others whom we consider valuable assets to be nurtured and developed. Our goal is to impart quality education, guided by Albert Einstein’s insight that "Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think." May Allah bless us with crowning success in all our endeavors. Ameen.</p>
