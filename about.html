          Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan, is one of the leading
          educational institutions in the Malir Cantonment region of Karachi.

          With a rich history spanning over three decades, we have consistently

          character development. Our institution has produced numerous
          distinguished alumni who have gone on to achieve remarkable success in
